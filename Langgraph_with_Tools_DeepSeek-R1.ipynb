Explore the difference between AI and machine learning, the types of AI, and the benefits and dangers of AI. Artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems with the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experiences. AI is transforming modern life, but some critics worry about its potential misuse and environmental impact. Artificial Intelligence (AI) operates on a core set of concepts and technologies that enable machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Here are some foundational concepts: Machine Learning (ML) Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. Instead of being explicitly ... AI is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that can perform tasks such as learning, problem-solving, and natural language processing. Learn about the origins, evolution, components, and types of AI, and how it is transforming various industries and aspects of daily life.\""

An agentic AI system is designed to make decisions, handle complex situations and, in some cases, adjust its behavior autonomously. In the last case, the AI agent operates without human oversight, instead using algorithms and environmental data to optimize its behavior. Agentic AI is an autonomous AI system that plans, reasons and acts to complete tasks with minimal oversight. We'll give its characteristics and real-world examples in this article.
